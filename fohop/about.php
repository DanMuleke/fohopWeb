        Fountain of hope is a Local non governmental, non racial and non proft making organization whose purpose 
        is to bring hope to the rural areas of Malawi through empowering the community members in becoming own 
        problem solvers of all the problems and challenges faced in their respective communities. The organisation 
        was formed in 2011 by a group of four people afer observing the challenges faced by the communities in 
        Malawi. It is legally registered by the government of Malawi as well as Council for Non Governmental 
        organisation of Malawi (CONGOMA).

        <h1 style="color:azure; font-size:60px;">STRATEGY APPROACH</h1>
        <p class="">
        Te implementation of the strategy will mainly be based on Securing Livelihoods and Action on Climate Change in the rural areas which in
brief is about making sure that people in the rural areas are able to secure income and resources necessary to meet basic needs and survive to
shocks which are inﬂuenced by climate change thus strengthening the communities’ ability of accessing sufcient food and income, and having
more control when they access these essential lifelines. Tis will see the communities with improved Health, Agriculture production and food
security, Education, Enterprise development and access to markets, practicing environmental friendly activities, adaptation to climate change
impacts.
Te idea of securing Livelihoods and action on climate change must therefore always be taken into consideration in all matters of community
development.
Tere is no reason of sidelining, diﬀerentiating or gapping people’s lives in rural areas and those in urban areas where the latter have had the
majority with better living always. Ironically, majority of agricultural produce come from the rural areas where more farming takes place.
Small scale Farmers in rural areas are soon deprived of their own produce which they had sweated for, through selling them at low prices to
people and companies living in urban areas afer which they become vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty. Tis situation forces these
small scale farmers to buy expensive food which are just being processed from their own produce from the shops and make them enter into
loans when securing inputs for the next growing season which they buy at high prices from the same companies they sold their produce at low
prices. In this case Livelihood has been missing in rural areas where majority are not able to secure income and resources necessary to meet
basic needs in their lives.
When it comes to climate change impacts, people in the rural areas are more vulnerable than those in urban. For example, in Malawi, there
have been more dangerous cases of ﬂoods, heavy destructive winds, disease outbreaks and earthquakes in rural areas where people have lost
properties, livestock’s and sometimes lives. Tis is because less eﬀort is done so far in sensitising people in rural areas about climate change
issues. Now people think that there is nothing they can do to mitigate the risk of climate change since they lack of knowledge.
In implementing the strategy , Fountain Of Hope (FOHOP) has to address the following 2 key issues, Securing a Livelihood community with
improvement in: Health, Agriculture production and food security, Education, Enterprise development and access to markets and Making the
community adapt to climate change impacts where practicing environmental friendly activities should be a routine in the lives of the people.However, the strategy does not imply that Fountain of Hope will do everything and in all rural areas, but it implies that Fountain Of Hope will
do what it can and will be able to form strategic alliances with other actors who are better placed to provide services that Fountain of Hope
cannot provide due to whatever reasons like fnances.
Te 2012 statistical year book of Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on Trade, Food Stability and food security stated that trade assists
food security in staple food production systems undergoing wide ﬂuctuation caused by variable climates especially in those systems that are
rain fed, high coefcients in the variation of staple food production -10% and above – are common in much of sub- Saharan Africa. Tis means
that a shortfall of at least 10% of average staple production occurs every six years. Instability in food production can also lead to global markets; beyond production instability trade defcits in many of the most food-insecure countries have become structural over the past two decades. Expensive inputs, high shipment costs and high losses from farms to markets have lowered the competitiveness of the agricultural sector
in many developing countries. Tis means that more actions are needed to be taken in securing livelihoods in the rural areas of the Sub Saharan countries where Malawi is one of the aﬀected ones.
According to little data book 2011 – Te World bank group, which is a pocket Edition of World Development Indicator, the National poverty
rate in Malawi was 52.4% from the population of 15.3 million people in 2009.
Value added in agriculture (% of GDP) was 31% While on health data, Under fve mortality rate ( per 1000) was 110 ,Child malnutrition, underweight (% of under age 5) was 15.5% ,Primary completion rate total (% of relevant age group) was 59%. Ten on Environment, Deforestation (average annual %, 1990–2010) was 0.6%,
Freshwater use (% of internal resources) was 6%, Access to improved water source (% of total population.) was 80%, Access to improved sanitation facilities (% of total population.) was 56%., Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (metric tons) was 0.1.
As per the little data book 2011 – Te World Bank group, the fght on health and environment need not to be lef out. Tere is need of strengthening the activities in both rural and urban areas so as to improve the sectors in question. Tis involves utilising community and government
resources optimally with full support of one another. Fountain of Hope interventions will therefore focus also on strengthening the capacity of
the community to react to these situations timely.
In this case Fountain of Hope is to prioritise contents of this strategy according to its own values, available resources, expertise and the knowledge of what others are doing in similar spheres of activity.
Tis strategy is in line with the following United Nations (UN) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which are a set of specifc targets to be
met by 2015 and probably post 2015.
• eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
• Promote gender equality and empower women.
• combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases
• ensure environmental sustainability
• Develop a global partnership for development.
Programming Framework
Te model of programming is derived from the two basic result areas of securing livelihoods and action on climate change.
2. ACTUAL STRATEGY
2.1 PRIORITY RESULT AREAS
Tis section presents the Fountain of Hope priority result areas and strategies
A: SECURING LIVELIHOODS
While signifcant Livelihoods programmes have been taking place over the years, very few people have benefted from such programmes. Tis
is because there are more people in rural areas than the services which were delivered in these areas. In other ways there is still more demand
of reaching other areas where the programme never took place but people are still suﬀering. Having this background the major objective of this
result area focus is to save and serve the rural societies from slavery situation arising due to lack of knowledge in how to get out of it and also to
complement the government eﬀort in securing rural livelihoods in the country.
Te above result area will be achieved through implementing the following strategies:1. Securing food security.
- Fountain of Hope recognises the important role played by small scale farmers in the communities. However, they are facing growing
challenges in the form of declining investment in agriculture, outdated skills and technology and lack of access to quality inputs. Tese small
scale farmers lack of innovation and development of agricultural enterprises. For example, small scale farmers are lacking access to knowledge in
irrigation farming, learning new sustainable agricultural production techniques and to diversify crop production to increase incomes. Terefore
Fountain of Hope is there to equip these small scale farmers with knowledge of how to go about the mentioned situations which enable farmers
to increase in agricultural production, thus Farmer training.
2. Enterprise development and access to markets
- Many people in rural areas have the capacity of doing diﬀerent activities but they do not have knowledge. Tis is where Fountain of Hope
(FOHOP) will intervene. People are to be trained in how to identify and run Income generating activities from the little resources they may acquire. People’s mind will be opened through sharing experiences and ideas on how others earn a living in other areas. Tis time now the benefciaries are to look around the raw materials in their areas which can be processed and bring income to their families.
- On access to markets, people are to be organised in groups so that it should be easier to sell and buy their produce, products, inputs and
materials. Government recognised buyers will be invited for a visit to area of operation and the also a committee will be formed to be researching for better markets.
- Cooperatives will be formed ensure total collective eﬀort and sustainability of the activities.
3. Improved Health activities
In ensuring that the programme should not be disturbed due bad health of the benefciaries, Fountain of Hope will conduct health and hygiene
like, sensitisation in some critical health issues like those of HIV and Aids, under fve children’s health, Malnutrition to children , actions on
planting of herbs for immunisation of the body, cooking demonstration of nutritious food from the local food, Securing freshwater use and
access to improved water source and improved sanitation facilities because healthy people can bring healthy results
4. Education Mobilisation
- Where there is literacy there is always smoother communication because a message can also be passed through writing so the needed
person just read it. Where there is illiteracy there is no such possibility. As such Fountain of Hope will introduce adult literacy education and
pre schools to its operation areas, will also mobilise parents and local leaders to make sure that children go to school. Not only that, but alsopromoting girls education in order to avoid repeating the same situation of women discrimination in education which has resulted into many
women becoming uneducated followed by de empowerment.
5. Orphanage care
Fountain of Hope shall secure the lives of vulnerable children by giving out support in education, feeding and parental care needed by children. In this case centre for orphans will be established. However, the support shall also go to other orphanage centres which need help.
6. Community Based Care centre
Te organisation will establish community Based care centres where children will be taken care of through education and social support, people
with HIV AIDS will be getting counselling and lessons, Maternity issues of mothers will be sensitised, elderly and disabled people will be provided with diﬀerent services.
7. Relief aid
Te organisation shall support the vulnerable community with diﬀerent relief items and services like food, clothes, diﬀerent facilities and diﬀerent charity services as per need.
8. Water supply for both irrigation and drinking.
Te organisation will mobilise the community and well wishers in securing water facilities for irrigation and drinking like Rope and washer
pumps, treadle pumps, bore holes, tap water and any other technology that contributes to water accessibility.
B. ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
- Climate change has brought a lot of changes all over the world. Deaths have been registered in all over the worlds due to climate change, new
diseases have been born due to climate, and droughts have increased as well. Malawi has not been spared, prevailing ﬂoods in many areas with
lots of losses of people’s properties including crop production. However, these entire situations have come into existence due to human deeds.
Terefore, on action on climate change, FOHOP will ensure that the development activities undertaken today do not inadvertently make communities more vulnerable to climate change impacts tomorrow the result area will be achieved through implementing the following strategies
1. Community adaptation to climate change impacts.
• - FOHOP will be building adaptive capacity to climate change eﬀects at the community level where will work with local communities to
strengthen their
Ability to respond to eﬀects of climate change timely and the programme will involve all age and sex groups that is to say adults, youths, men
and women at various levels to equip them with the appropriate skills. Institutions like schools, churches, club centres and the community in
general will be utilised in passing out the information of climate change adaptation.- Exchange Programmes
Te benefciaries who are undergoing the capacity building in climate change adaptation will have exchange programmes locally, regionally and
nationally, to learn from other people in other parts of the country where similar situation is being acted upon. Tis will provide regional and
national exposure in the moulding of adaptation capacity.
• Networking
Strategic partnerships and networks will be developed with organisations in the country and in other countries that share the same burden and
vision for the people in rural areas. Tis will allow the exchange of experience, good practices and expertise.
2. Practicing environmental friendly activities (Environmental conservation).
- A human being has contributed a lot to the climate change eﬀects today just because he had not been practicing environmental friendly activities on day to day activities. It has been observed and noted that many farmers had not been friendly to environment during their production resulting into land degradation, loss of soil fertility, soil erosion, ﬂooding just to mention some. Not only farmers but also non farmers had greatly
destroyed the environment by deforestation, plastic materials littering just to mention a few .FOHOP will implement this strategy through the
following steps:
• Dissemination of Information
Tis will be done through research of new information on how the environment has been destroyed in the operational areas as a vivid evidence
for not practicing recommended activities. Here campaigns will be conducted in various community institutions like schools, community
groupings, and church on awareness of environmental conservation.
Farmers will be trained in sustainable agriculture where conservation agriculture will be more emphasised as a suitable method of farming.
• Lobbying and Advocacy
Tis will involve lobbying for the enforcement of policies and laws that protect the environment, and set by- laws of protecting the environment
with the aid of local leaders and government ofcers and other stakeholders.
• Capacity Building
Tis will involve strengthening the capacity of those people working with environment issues to operate in local institutions on how organiseevents pertaining environmental conservation.
3. Mitigating measures to hazards
Actions on reducing the risks of disaster will be carried out in the community as follows:
- Tere will be Capacity Strengthening on reclaiming the destroyed environmental features like rivers, streams, mountains, hills through planting of trees in these features, promote agro forestry, gully reclamation, correct land use, promote conservation agriculture.
- A committee will be formed for ensuring that the strategies of mitigating the risk are being implemented and researching for more new ways of
reducing the risks.
• Networking
Strategic partnerships and networks will be developed with organisations in the country and in other countries that share the same burden and
vision for the people in rural areas. Tis will allow the exchange of experience, good practices and expertise.
2.1.1 FOUNTAIN OF HOPE AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Fountain of Hope will achieve more results if its activities are strongly embedded within the community it is operating in. Te following strategies will ensure the strengthening of the relations between Fountain of Hope and the Community.
1) Marketing
Tis will involve advertising Fountain of Hope programmes to various institutions and the community at large. Te aim is to engage, equip and
enable the community to get involved in programming in a sustainable way. Not only that but also, for other far away societies to know what is
supposed to take place in their lives.
2) Partnership Development
Tis entails forging and establishment of partnerships with specifc organisations at local, national and international levels in implementing particular programmes in specifc communities where such partnerships improve the impact of Fountain of Hope programme.
3) Community Engagement
Tis will involve the inclusion of communities and relevant institutions in communities in all programmes the Fountain of Hope will be conducting in each community. Tis will ensure getting maximum support from the community and various institutions followed by sustainability
of the program activities.
2.1.2 ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Te organisation keeps on learning from its experiences, and practices and it also adapts to the changing world to ensure and maintain its relevance to the community. Hence Fountain of Hope will implement the following strategies to achieve this objective.
1) Capacity Building
Tis involves continuous review of staﬀ development programmes to strengthen the capacity of Fountain of Hope volunteers, Staﬀ, management
board and council. Various human resources needs and requirements will be identifed to ensure their contribution to the achievement of the
strategic document.
2) Systems and Policy Development
Tis involves reviewing and updating the existing policies for organisational regulation and management. Tis also includes bringing in of modern technology for use to improve the operations of the organisation.
3) Resource Mobilisation
Tis involves the marketing of this strategic document to funding partners, and initiating income generation programmes for the organisation.
Such resource mobilisation programmes enable the organisation to fulfl its mandate and achieve its goals and objectives.
4) Generation and Documentation of Information
To ensure that Fountain of Hope is a learning organisation, the organisation will research new information, and document its experiences and
practices for learning purposes. Tis information will be used for decision making purposes by the Council, Management Board and feld staﬀ
