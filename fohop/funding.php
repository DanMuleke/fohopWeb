    <p>
        All structures of FOHOP have a role in fundraising. They actively seek to raise funds from diffrent sectors in order to excel more 
        in community activities. Fohop has developed principles which are used in fundraising:
    </p>
    <ol style="margin-left:10px;">
        <li><b>Integrity</b><br>This is about managing affirs wisely, communicating needs, and responsible reporting.</li>
        <li><b>Capacity building</b><br>This involves developing ways of funding the programs at grassroots levels.</li>
        <li><b>Partnership</b><br>This is done by responding to the needs around us and encouraging partnership among members in such needs.</li>
        <li><b>Equity</b><br>Focus on needy priorities and fair and reasonable usage of resources.
        <li><b>Minimising bureaucracy</b><br>This is achieved by agreeing a reasonable plan and cost for administration</li>
    </ol>
